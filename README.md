# Higher-Order Cross Convergent Mapping for Tensor Time Series

In this mini-study, I use low-dimension representations of tensor time series (short animated videos) to analyze the series for causality. To do this, I introduce a multidimensional modification for cross convergent mapping. The low-dimension representations of the tensor time series are obtained from the higher-order singular value decomposition of the series: I use the time dimension factor matrix as the low-dimensional representation.

This is a laboratory work for the second semester of the Mathematical Forecasting Methods course.
